Small solutions for Advent of Code 2025.
Currently doing it on Windows instead of Ubuntu and making sure to make everyone suffer from it by using a Powershell script to run each challenges in my repository <3 May you enjoy the pain ! 

Run (PowerShell, from repository root):

```powershell
.\run.ps1 <day> <part> [input-file]
# example: run Day 1 Part 1 using the default input
.\run.ps1 1 1
```

Requirements
- Java JDK (javac and java) available on PATH.
